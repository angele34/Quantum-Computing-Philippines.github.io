The Quantum Computing Society of the Philippines, also known as OneQuantum PH, extends our heartfelt gratitude to ASTI and the iTANONG project for making QCSP part of the inaugural ASTICON event and for the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement between iTANONG and QCSP.

iTANONG, a 3-year project that started in 2022, aims to develop a natural language interface to relational databases (NLIDB). This artificial intelligence (AI) application can be accessed through a web browser or a mobile app that will enable end-users to key in questions in Filipino, English, or TagLish, with the potential to accommodate more languages in future research.

At this thrilling juncture, where generative AI is evolving rapidly and the dawn of quantum computing is upon us, the potential and promise of these technologies are immense. The Memorandum of Agreement with the iTANONG project places OneQuantum PH in a unique superposition of AI and quantum computing, opening new avenues for innovation and development.

One of the most exciting outcomes of this collaboration is the launch of a 10-week lecture series and hackathon focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) with quantum computing. This initiative is not just an academic endeavor but a significant step toward integrating these advanced technologies into practical, everyday applications. By bringing together the best minds in AI and quantum computing, OneQuantum PH aims to foster a deeper understanding and drive forward-thinking solutions.

This cooperation comes at a particularly opportune time, as the upcoming year marks the United Nations Year of Quantum. QCSP is honored to be recognized as a partner in this global event, which will feature a series of activities across Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao throughout the year. This partnership will not only help quantum-enable the country but also educate many Filipinos on maximizing the use of NLP, particularly large language models.

The Quantum Computing Society of the Philippines is excited about the tremendous opportunities this collaboration brings. With the support of DOST-ASTI and the iTANONG project, they look forward to contributing to an AI-powered and quantum-enabled economy, paving the way for a future where advanced technologies drive progress and innovation.
