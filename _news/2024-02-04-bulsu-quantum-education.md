A groundbreaking collaboration towards a more quantum-literate Philippines unfolded as Bulacan State University (BulSu) and OneQuantum PH — the Quantum Computing Society of the Philippines, joined forces under the leadership of Jayson Victoriano. Last year, Victoriano spearheaded the BulSu Quantum Leap Project under DOST-PCIEERD’s RIEETOOL Program, resulting in a memorandum of agreement aimed at bolstering the nation's capacity in quantum computing.

The participants include faculty members from the College of Science, Math Department, Data Science, the College of Information and Communication Technology, and the Computer Engineering departments from the Malolos Bulacan campus, as well as external campuses such as Bustos Campus, Sarmiento Campus, Hagonoy Campus, and Meneses Campus.

At the heart of this collaboration is the BulSu Quantum Leap Lecture Series—a 12-Saturday program delving into the intricate foundations of quantum computing. The curriculum spans essential mathematics for quantum computing, complexity theory comparing runtimes of quantum and classical algorithms, and an exploration of standard quantum algorithms such as Deutsch-Jozsa, Bernstein-Vazirani, Grover’s algorithm, and the revolutionary Shor’s algorithm for RSA and elliptic curve cryptography.

Participants also gain insights into optimization using quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning, setting the stage for innovation in the realm of quantum technologies. The course culminates in a panel presentation where participants can propose projects leveraging quantum computing.

In addition to the existing curriculum, the series will incorporate an in-depth exploration of quantum key distribution. Moreover, participants will touch briefly on post-quantum cryptography, anticipating and preparing for the future of secure communication in the quantum era.

A significant milestone in the series occurred during the recent face-to-face session at the BulSu Malolos Bulacan campus on February 2nd. The event not only witnessed the esteemed presence of Chancellor Dr. Renaldo S. Naguit and former President Dr. Cecilia N. Gascon, who personally greeted the participants and representatives from OneQuantum PH, but also highlighted the invaluable support of the current BulSu President, Dr. Teody C. San Andres, in hosting the training and workshop. Furthermore, the active participation of ASTI-DOST added another layer of significance to the event, fostering a collaborative environment for advancing quantum computing education.

Speakers at the event included:

- Dylan Josh Lopez: Quantum Computing and Optimization Researcher/Educator and PhD Student at Chung Yuan Christian University, Taiwan

- Bobby O Corpus Jr: President, OneQuantum PH

Facilitators:

- Jabez Ayson: Director of Operations at OneQuantum PH

- Elmer Peramo: Senior Science Research Specialist at DOST-ASTI

- Jeffrey Aborot: Supervising Science Research Specialist at DOST-ASTI

- Henry Adorna: Professor of Theoretical Computer Science at the Univesity of the Philippines, Diliman Campus
