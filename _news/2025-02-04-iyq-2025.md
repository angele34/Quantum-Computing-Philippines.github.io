Quantum theory underpins some of the most groundbreaking innovations of our time. From the smallest building blocks of the universe to the chips powering artificial intelligence, radio waves, lasers, modern medicine, and advanced materials, quantum mechanics has transformed industries and shaped the modern world. Recognizing its pivotal role, the **United Nations has declared 2025 as the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology (IYQST)**. This global milestone commemorates 100 years since Werner Heisenberg laid the foundations of quantum mechanics.

As we stand on the brink of a new technological era, quantum computing is poised to revolutionize fields like finance, logistics, telecommunications, and information technology. With its ability to solve problems far beyond the reach of today’s supercomputers, quantum computing promises to redefine industries and tackle challenges previously deemed insurmountable.

QCSP: Leading Quantum Innovation in the Philippines
We, the Quantum Computing Society of the Philippines (QCSP) is proud to [join the celebration of the International Year of Quantum](https://quantum2025.org/endorsing-organizations/). Established in 2017 as **Quantum Computing Philippines**, QCSP is the country's leading organization dedicated to promoting quantum information science and technology. Over the years, QCSP has built a vibrant community of professionals, researchers, academics, and students, hosting initiatives like meetups, lecture series, hackathons, and Train-the-Trainers programs.

As the only quantum-focused organization in the Philippines, QCSP is committed to fostering an inclusive and innovative quantum ecosystem. Its mission is to empower Filipinos through education and collaboration, paving the way for sustainable growth in quantum science and technology.

# 2025: A Year of Quantum-Powered Events

To celebrate the International Year of Quantum, QCSP has planned a series of exciting activities throughout 2025:

**February 8**: A national online webinar will kick off the celebrations, introducing the fundamentals of quantum theory to audiences across the country. Register here!

**July**: The Philippines' first-ever Quantum Information Conference will take place in Mactan, Cebu, featuring leading researchers from Southeast Asia, the US, and Europe.

**August**: Filipino talent will shine on the global stage at a regional quantum computing hackathon hosted in Thailand.

**Throughout 2025**: QCSP will conduct three Quantum Computing Lecture Series, each culminating in hands-on hackathons addressing real-world challenges like cybersecurity and blockchain.

# Inspiring the Next Generation

QCSP envisions a future where quantum technology becomes a core part of the Philippine education system. In 2025, the organization will launch an initiative to introduce quantum concepts to elementary and high school students. Terms like qubits, superposition, and entanglement will become part of the vocabulary of young learners, ensuring that the Filipinos are quantum-capable and future generations are well-prepared for the quantum era.

Building Partnerships and Community
QCSP's efforts are supported by strong partnerships with the **Department of Science and Technology (DOST)**, the **Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)**, and universities across Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. These collaborations have been instrumental in advancing quantum education and research, fostering innovation, and positioning the Philippines as a rising force in the global quantum community.

# Join the Quantum Movement
As we celebrate the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology, QCSP invites individuals and organizations to join this exciting journey. Whether you’re a student, professional, or enthusiast eager to explore quantum computing, QCSP welcomes you to be part of this global revolution.
