OneQuantum Philippines is honored to have been a part of the prestigious 23rd Philippine Computing Science Congress 2023 held at the University of San Jose-Recoletos in Cebu City. We were invited to participate in the pre-congress event held on March 23-24, where we had the unique opportunity to present a hands-on demonstration on programming quantum circuits using QISKit.

The event was inaugurated by Mr. Jeffrey Aborot, Supervising Science Research Specialist and lead of the Computer Software Division, who set an inspiring tone for the upcoming presentations and workshops. Among the esteemed list of participants and speakers, our very own Bobby Corpus, President of OneQuantum PH, was given the privilege to demonstrate quantum programming.

Mr. Corpus' presentation aimed to simplify the complexity surrounding quantum computing and make it more accessible to the attendees. With the able assistance of Mr. Asher Manangan, they successfully demonstrated how to program quantum circuits using QISKit, a popular open-source software development kit (SDK) for quantum computers. The demonstration was a practical and engaging session that provided attendees with a clear understanding of quantum circuit programming.

We were thrilled to be part of such a respected event and contribute to the quantum computing discussions. It's crucial for more people to understand and engage with quantum computing, and we're proud to have played a part in that today.

Our participation in the 23rd Philippine Computing Science Congress underscores OneQuantum PH's commitment to promoting quantum computing in the Philippines. We believe that events like these that encourage sharing knowledge and practical learning experiences play a vital role in advancing the field.

We are deeply grateful for the opportunity to share our knowledge and expertise at the congress, and we look forward to contributing further to the progress of quantum computing in the Philippines.
