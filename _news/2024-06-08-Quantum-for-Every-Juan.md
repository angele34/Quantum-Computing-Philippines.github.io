The **United Nations General Assembly** declares 2025 as the [International Year of Quantum Science and Technology (IYQ)](https://quantum2025.org/). This proclamation coincides with the 100th anniversary of quantum mechanics, a field that enables advancements in various fields from medical imaging to satellite navigation, among many others. As a year-long campaign, the IYQ realizes the potential of quantum science as a tool to solve pressing issues globally. 

The road to IYQ began in November 2023. Mexico championed an initial proposal by a coalition of scientific organizations, which was presented at **UNESCO's 42nd General Conference**. Following this, Ghana formally submitted a draft resolution to the **U.N. General Assembly** in May 2024. This resolution gained the support of over 70 countries, ultimately leading to today's official proclamation.

Alongside leading [international societies and organizations](https://quantum2025.org/en/partners/), the Philippines is geared to join this call through the [Quantum Computing Society of the Philippines](https://www.qcsp.ph/) (QCSP, also known as OneQuantum Philippines) as a founding partner. The society has spearheaded efforts to make quantum concepts more accessible through events such as hackathons and learning sessions. Through the auspices of the IYQ, QCSP is poised to organize more initiatives to introduce quantum principles to Filipinos at all levels. 

Bobby Corpus, QCSP President, believes that *“participation in the International Year of Quantum signifies* our **commitment to innovation, capacity-building, global collaboration, and raising awareness of quantum technologies among Filipinos** as early as possible”. This celebration recognizes that quantum computing can enrich the lives of Filipinos by opening more doors for innovation and careers by bringing “visibility, prestige, and preparation for future technological advancements, ensuring we remain relevant and competitive in a rapidly evolving global market”, Mr. Corpus adds.

Quantum mechanics, often considered mind-bending, describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level. It's the foundation for many of the technologies we rely on daily, from the transistors in our computers to the lasers used in medical procedures.

But the true power of quantum science is still on track to be fully unleashed. Advances in quantum applications are leading to revolutionary innovations in medicine, materials science, communication, and beyond. Imagine faster drug discovery, unbreakable encryption, and previously unimaginable materials with unique properties. **The possibilities are vast**.

Through participation in the IYQ, QCSP aims to bring quantum principles to Filipinos' consciousness through an engaging line-up of educational materials and training opportunities. The society envisions the Philippines’ involvement in the ever-growing vibrant quantum ecosystem worldwide.

The [International Year of Quantum of Quantum Science and Technology](https://quantum2025.org/) is a year-long, global initiative to recognize the importance of quantum science and technology and strengthen national capacities for science education and research.

The [Quantum Computing Society of the Philippines](https://onequantum.ph/) (QCSP, also known as OneQuantum Philippines) is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting quantum science and technology research and education in the Philippines. QCSP fosters a collaborative community of researchers, enthusiasts, and stakeholders to develop a globally competitive Philippine quantum ecosystem.
