In a significant stride towards global collaboration in quantum technologies, Elmer Peramo, representing the Philippines and OneQuantum Philippines, participated as an observer in the 1st IEC/ISO Joint Technical Committee (JTC) 3 Plenary Meeting. This event was organized by the Korean Agency for Technology and Standards (KATS) under the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy (MOTIE). It took place in Seoul, Republic of Korea, from May 28 to May 30, 2024.

Elmer Peramo's participation came through a nomination by One Quantum Philippines to the Department of Trade and Industry in the Philippines, underscoring the Philippines' commitment to contributing to the global discourse on quantum technologies and their applications.

The meeting marked a crucial step in the standardization of quantum technologies, bringing together experts from around the world to discuss the future of this rapidly advancing field. Throughout the three-day event, participants engaged in comprehensive discussions on various aspects of quantum technology standardization. Key topics included the development of standards for quantum sensors, quantum secure communications, and designing standards for end users. Presentations from international delegates highlighted the latest advancements and collaborative efforts in quantum technologies.
