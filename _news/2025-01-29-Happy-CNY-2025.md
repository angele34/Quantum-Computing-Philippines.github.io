Happy Lunar New Year 2025! As we welcome the Year of the Wood Snake, the Quantum Computing Society of the Philippines (QCSP) celebrates a momentous convergence with the United Nations' declaration of 2025 as the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology.

## A Year of Double Significance

This auspicious alignment marks a transformative period for quantum computing in the Philippines. QCSP has already begun its quantum initiatives, as demonstrated by the successful EmbarQuantum workshop at PSU last November, and continues to build momentum with an exciting lineup of quantum education and research activities throughout 2025.

## Looking Forward

The Year of the Wood Snake symbolizes wisdom, intelligence, and adaptability - qualities that perfectly align with QCSP's mission to advance quantum technology in the Philippines. The Snake's association with deep thinking and strategic planning resonates with the complex nature of quantum computing, while the Wood element brings growth, flexibility, and creativity. Through our partnerships with academic institutions, government agencies, and industry leaders, we are committed to fostering a quantum-ready Philippines in this landmark year.


As part of the IYQST, the QCSP has lined up a series of activities across the country:

- **February 8** – A national online webinar on quantum theory will kick off the celebrations
- **July** – QCSP will host the first-ever Quantum Information Conference in the Philippines in Mactan, Cebu, featuring leading researchers from Southeast Asia, the US, and Europe
- **August** – The Philippines will participate at a regional quantum computing hackathon hosted by Thailand
- **Throughout 2025** – QCSP will conduct three Quantum Computing Lecture Series, each culminating in hackathons focused on topics like cybersecurity and blockchain

## Bringing Quantum to the Next Generation

The year 2025 will be a milestone year for introducing quantum technology to a wider audience in the Philippines. QCSP is launching an educational initiative designed to introduce quantum computing concepts to elementary and high school students. The organization envisions a future where Filipinos are quantum-capable, ensuring that terms like qubits, superposition, entanglement, tunneling, and interference become familiar concepts to future generations.

## A Growing Community with Strong Partnerships

QCSP's growth and impact are made possible through the invaluable support of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and its partnerships with universities across Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. This collaboration has been instrumental in advancing quantum education and research in the Philippines, fostering innovation and shaping the future of quantum technology in the country.

## Join the Quantum Revolution!

As we celebrate the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology (IYQST), the Quantum Computing Society of the Philippines (QCSP) invites students, professionals, and organizations to be part of this global movement. Whether you're eager to explore quantum computing or take part in our initiatives, we'd love to connect with you!
