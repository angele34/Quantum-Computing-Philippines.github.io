We at OneQuantum PH are delighted to share that we participated as one of the panelist at the Quantum.Tech Singapore event, held on April 4-5 at the Equarius Hotel. The prestigious summit, touted as the world's leading quantum technology conference, convenes global experts in quantum computing, cryptography, sensing, and algorithms.

The event, which brings together enterprises, governments, academics, and solution providers to discuss and strategize about quantum supremacy, was a vital opportunity for OneQuantum PH to contribute to the discourse on the future of quantum technology.

We participated in two significant discussions during the conference. The first, a fireside chat titled "Quantum's Talent of Tomorrow - How Serious is the Global Quantum Talent Gap and How Can We Combat the Skills Shortage to Prepare the Next Generation of Quantum Experts?" addressed the pressing issue of cultivating talent in this burgeoning field.

In the second panel, "What Roles Can the Public Sector Take in Supporting the Quantum Tech Industry for a Country's Quantum Roadmap?" we lent our perspective on the vital role of public-sector support in driving quantum tech industry growth.

We were thrilled to contribute to these pivotal discussions at Quantum.Tech Singapore. The quantum talent gap is a serious issue that the industry needs to address collectively. It was enlightening to share ideas and strategies with other experts on how we can tackle this challenge.

Our participation at this premier event underscores OneQuantum PH's commitment to leading the charge in quantum technology and contributing to the global quantum roadmap. We believe these conversations pave the way for a stronger quantum future and are proud to be part of them.
