The Quantum Computing Society of the Philippines (QCSP) is excited to announce an upcoming online meetup scheduled for August 10 at 6pm Philippine time. The event promises an engaging and educational experience for all participants, including students, teachers, academics, and anyone with an interest in the field of quantum computing.

During the meetup, Classiq.io, an organization at the forefront of quantum computing technology, will provide a comprehensive introduction to their quantum computing platform. The team from Classiq.io will walk participants through the functionalities and features of their cutting-edge technology and provide a live demonstration of how to use their platform.

What sets this meetup apart is that it's not just a simple presentation. Instead, it's an interactive workshop that will allow participants to get hands-on experience with the Classiq.io platform. Participants will have the unique opportunity to access and explore the platform during the workshop under the guidance of Classiq.io's experts.

We are thrilled to have Classiq.io as a part of our meetup. This event is not only a chance to learn about a key player in the quantum computing industry but also a great opportunity to practically engage with this advanced technology.

QCSP strongly encourages anyone with an interest in quantum computing to take part in this meetup. Whether you are a student, a teacher, an academic, or just a curious individual, this workshop will provide an excellent introduction and practical experience in quantum computing.

Interested individuals are encouraged to mark their calendars and join the QCSP for this interactive and informative meetup. Together, we can deepen our understanding of quantum computing and explore the potential that this advanced technology holds.
