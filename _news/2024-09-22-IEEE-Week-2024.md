Last week, the **IEEE Quantum Week 2024** in Montreal, brought together quantum computing enthusiasts, researchers, and professionals from around the globe. We are proud to say that the **Quantum Computing Society of the Philippines** (QCSP) made its presence felt through our member and representative, **Dylan Josh Lopez**, who is a PhD student at Chung Yuan Christian University in Taiwan.

Dylan presented our paper entitled "**Quantum Computing Society of the Philippines: An NGO Perspective on Promoting Quantum Information, Science, and Technology in the Philippines*," co-authored by **Bobby Corpus, Elmer Peramo, Jabez Ayson, Angela Nicole Masongsong, and Lance Dominic Raquel**. The paper presents the initiatives and efforts of QCSP to advance quantum education and technology capacity in the Philippines. It provides an overview of our society's activities, comparing them with similar efforts in neighboring Asian countries.

Our research focuses on the unique role of a non-governmental organization (NGO) like QCSP in promoting quantum technology in a developing country. The paper details various strategic activities and educational initiatives undertaken by QCSP, including hackathons, workshops, curriculum development, and collaborations. Through a narrative supported by figures and tables, the paper illustrates the practical implications of QCSP's programs and addresses specific challenges faced by the Philippine demographic, along with the strategies implemented to meet local needs.

#Significance of the Paper
Our paper presented by Dylan is a contribution to the growing body of literature on quantum education and capacity building in developing countries. It offers insights and a framework that could be applicable in similar contexts globally, and we hope that it will be a valuable read for conference participants from developing countries seeking guidance on promoting quantum outreach and education.

#Building Global Connections
In addition to presenting our paper, Dylan had the opportunity to meet with Mariana Filipova, Founder and CEO of STEALM Academy based in Bulgaria. STEALM Academy is QCSP's partner in bringing quantum technology knowledge to elementary and high school students in the Philippines, highlighting the society's commitment to early education in this cutting-edge field.

#Engaging with Quantum Industry Leaders

During the conference, Dylan also talked with several leading companies in the quantum computing industry in the hopes of contributing to the development of the Philippine quantum ecosystem. These companies included **QuEra, Quantinuum, Google Quantum, IBM Quantum, IonQ, Azure Quantum, Fujitsu Quantum, Rigetti, ClassiQ, and IQM**. We hope that these interactions are a step forward in fostering international partnerships and collaborations that could benefit the growth and advancement of quantum technology in the Philippines.

#Connecting with Fellow Filipinos in Quantum Research
Dylan also had the opportunity to meet two fellow Filipinos making strides in the field of quantum computing. Miguel Palma, a 2nd-year PhD student at Fordham University, is currently researching Quantum Computing and Distributed Systems, while Alvin Gonzales has been working at Argonne National Laboratory on quantum error correction since 2021. These connections demonstrate the global reach of Filipino talent in quantum technology and research, further strengthening the network of Filipino professionals in the field.

#Poster Presentation on QUBO Algorithm for Real-Time Object Detection
In addition to presenting QCSP's paper, Dylan also took part in a poster presentation on a research paper titled "Performance Analysis of QUBO Non-Maximum Suppression Algorithm for Real-Time Object Detection." This paper, written by researchers from Chung Yuan Christian University, includes several co-authors: **John Carlo Perion and Ariane Gara**, both representing the **University of Sto. Tomas**; **Dylan Josh Lopez**, representing **De La Salle University** while being an alumnus of **Adamson University**; and **Ruth Danielle Espa√±ola and Alfred Jerome Postrado**, who are alumni of **Adamson University** and **Mapua University**, respectively.
