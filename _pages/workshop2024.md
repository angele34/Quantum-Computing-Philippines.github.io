This workshop intends to introduce the computing community in the country to Quantum Computing.  The main goal of the workshop is to put together in one venue individuals who are working on, interested in, and curious about quantum computing, itâ€™s power to solves interesting problems and its limitations.   We hope to provide a friendly atmosphere during the workshop for individuals or group of individuals to share their output and experiences working on quantum computing. This maiden workshop aims to prepare participants in understanding and appreciation of the power of quantum computing through a short tutorial on quantum algorithm and programming.

### Topics (but not limited to):
Quantum algorithms, quantum annealing, quantum communications, quantum cryptography, quantum decoherence, quantum error correction, quantum programming, quantum sensing, quantum simulations, post quantum cryptography

### Submission
We invite everyone who have been working on quantum computing to submit an Extended Abstract of their work with at most three (3) pages long.  The Extended Abstract must contain (a) the problem you intend to consider/solve in your work; (b) quantum computing technique you used in solving the problem; (c) the results of your computation/simulations, and (d) finally your conclusion.

We invite submissions of works-in-progress, interactive / simulation demos, and position papers that contribute to the advancement of Quantum Information, Communication, and Technology (QICT) research in the Philippines.

### Proceedings
Accepted papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which will be announced soon.
