This workshop intends to introduce the computing community in the country to Quantum Computing.  The main goal of the workshop is to put together in one venue individuals who are working on, interested in, and curious about quantum computing, itâ€™s power to solves interesting problems and its limitations.   We hope to provide a friendly atmosphere during the workshop for individuals or group of individuals to share their output and experiences working on quantum computing. This maiden workshop aims to prepare participants in understanding and appreciation of the power of quantum computing through a short tutorial on quantum algorithm and programming.

### Keynote Speaker

<b>Lattice Cryptography: Theory, Applications, and Standardization Efforts</b>
<br/>

*David Earl Robles*

This presentation provides a mathematical introduction to lattice cryptography,
exploring its theoretical underpinnings, practical applications, and ongoing
standardization initiatives. Lattice cryptography stands as a bedrock for many next-
generation post-quantum cryptographic protocols, as evidenced by the recent draft
documents published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in
November 2023. These drafts emphasize the critical role of lattice-based cryptography
in shaping future security landscapes, potentially replacing current Elliptic Curve
Cryptography (ECC).
The presentation will begin with a discussion of the theoretical foundations of lattice
cryptography, explaining its mathematical structures and the underlying hardness
assumptions that underpin its security guarantees. It will then delve into prominent
applications of lattice cryptography in key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), digital
signature schemes, and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) schemes. These
building blocks provide essential functionalities for the post-quantum era,
encompassing secure communication, verifiable data integrity, efficient key
management, and controlled data access with privacy preservation.

### Submission
We invite everyone who have been working on quantum computing to submit an Extended Abstract of their work with at most three (3) pages long.  The Extended Abstract must contain (a) the problem you intend to consider/solve in your work; (b) quantum computing technique you used in solving the problem; (c) the results of your computation/simulations, and (d) finally your conclusion. Please use the following template for the Extended Abstract, which can be obtained from <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1akxty7z9Z1quT28eizIiDRP89zSevb5s?usp=sharing">here</a>.

We invite submissions of **works-in-progress, interactive / simulation demos, and position papers** that contribute to the advancement of Quantum Information, Communication, and Technology (QICT) research in the Philippines.

### Proceedings
Accepted papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which will be announced soon.
